- Track token usage, storage consumption, and cost per user
- Include breakdown in monthly invoice and admin dashboards

### 💳 Billing & Invoicing

- Track team-level and user-level API usage

## 📦 Team API Endpoints

### 1. Create a Team

```http
POST /teams/create
````

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "team_name": "Research Team Alpha",
  "owner_user_id": "user_123"
}
```

---

### 2. Invite Team Member

```http
POST /teams/invite
```

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "team_id": "team_abc",
  "email": "newuser@example.com",
  "role": "Member",
  "inviter_id": "user_123"
}
```

---

### 3. Join Team via Invite

```http
POST /teams/join
```

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "invitation_token": "token_xyz",
  "user_id": "user_456"
}
```

---

### 4. Get Team API Key

```http
GET /teams/{team_id}/apikey
```

---

## 🧠 Inference API Usage (Team Context with User Tracking)

To log requests per team member, include both the API key and the user ID in headers:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nebulablock.ai/v1/inference \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <team_api_key>" \
  -H "X-User-ID: user_123" \
  -d '{ "model": "llama3", "prompt": "Translate to French: Hello" }'
```

---

## 📊 Usage Tracking Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE usage_records (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  team_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,        -- Per-user tracking
  usage_type TEXT,     -- 'inference', 'storage'
  amount NUMERIC,
  unit TEXT,           -- 'tokens', 'GB'
  cost NUMERIC,
  recorded_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

> You can index on `(team_id, user_id, recorded_at)` for fast lookups and analytics.

## 🧾 Invoicing API

### Generate Invoice

```http
POST /billing/invoice/generate
```

**Output Example:**

```json
{
  "invoice_id": "inv_001",

  "line_items": [...],
  "total": 7.5,
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2025-06-01",
  "member_breakdown": [
    { "user_id": "user_123", "tokens_used": 2000000, "cost": 1.0 },
    { "user_id": "user_456", "tokens_used": 3000000, "cost": 1.5 }
  ]
}
```

### Download Invoice PDF

```http
GET /billing/invoice/{invoice_id}/pdf

## 🔐 Role Permissions

| Role   | Invite Members | Access API | View Usage | Generate Invoice |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Owner  | ✅              | ✅          | ✅          | ✅                |

## 👥 Example User Flow

1. User A creates a team and invites User B.
2. Team API key is issued.
3. Each user includes their `user_id` via `X-User-ID` header on requests.
4. System logs both team-level and individual usage.
5. Admins view usage reports per member.
6. Invoice is generated monthly with usage breakdown.
