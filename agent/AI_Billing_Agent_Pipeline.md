# Decentralized AI Billing Agent Development Pipeline

**Date:** March 13, 2025  
This pipeline outlines the end-to-end process for developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining the Decentralized AI Billing Agent, a system that integrates trusted node validation, IPFS storage, and Coinbase AgentKit payments.

---

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of five key stages:
1. **Setup and Planning**
2. **Development**
3. **Testing**
4. **Deployment**
5. **Monitoring and Maintenance**

Each stage includes specific tasks, tools, and deliverables to ensure a robust and scalable product.

## Stage 1: Setup and Planning

### Objective
Establish the foundation for development, including tools, infrastructure, and requirements.

### Tasks
- **Define Requirements:**
  - Cryptographic signature verification for node validation.
  - IPFS storage for invoices and payment proofs.
  - Coinbase AgentKit integration for onchain payments.
  - Scalability for multi-chain support.
- **Select Tech Stack:**
  - **Language:** TypeScript (for AgentKit compatibility).
  - **Blockchain:** Ethereum (Base testnet initially).
  - **Storage:** IPFS (via Infura or local node).
  - **Libraries:** `ethers.js` (crypto), `ipfs-http-client` (storage), `@coinbase/agentkit` (payments).
- **Set Up Environment:**
  - Install Node.js, npm, and TypeScript.
  - Configure IPFS node (local or hosted).
  - Obtain Coinbase Developer Platform API key and wallet.
- **Version Control:**
  - Initialize Git repository (e.g., GitHub).

### Tools
- Git, GitHub
- Node.js, npm
- Infura IPFS or local IPFS node
- Coinbase Developer Platform

### Deliverables
- Project repository with README.
- Environment setup guide.
- Initial `package.json` with dependencies.

---

## Stage 2: Development

### Objective
Build the core functionality of the Agent.

### Tasks
- **Node Validation Module:**
  - Implement signature verification using `ethers.js`.
  - Example: `verifySignature(message, signature, nodeId)`.
- **IPFS Storage Module:**
  - Create functions to upload invoices and payment proofs to IPFS.
  - Example: `storeInvoice(invoice)` and `storePaymentProof(txHash, invoiceCid)`.
- **Payment Module:**
  - Integrate Coinbase AgentKit for onchain transactions.
  - Example: `payInvoice({ to, amount, cid })`.
- **Main Workflow:**
  - Combine modules into a single `processBilling` function.
  - Handle errors (e.g., invalid signatures, failed uploads).
- **CLI or API Interface:**
  - Develop a command-line interface (CLI) or REST API for user interaction.

### Tools
- TypeScript
- `ethers.js`
- `ipfs-http-client`
- `@coinbase/agentkit`
- VS Code (or preferred IDE)

### Deliverables
- Source code for all modules.
- Working prototype with CLI or API.
- Unit tests for each module (using Jest).

---

## Stage 3: Testing

### Objective
Ensure the Agent is reliable, secure, and performs as expected.

### Tasks
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Test signature verification with valid/invalid inputs.
  - Test IPFS uploads and CID retrieval.
  - Test payment execution on Base testnet.
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Simulate end-to-end billing process (node → invoice → payment → proof).
- **Security Testing:**
  - Verify resistance to replay attacks (nonce in signatures).
  - Check for IPFS data integrity (hash validation).
- **Performance Testing:**
  - Measure latency for IPFS uploads and payment processing.
  - Optimize for gas efficiency on blockchain.

### Tools
- Jest (unit testing)
- Hardhat (blockchain testing)
- IPFS test node
- Postman (API testing, if applicable)

### Deliverables
- Test reports with >90% code coverage.
- Bug fixes and optimizations.
- Documentation of test cases.

---

## Stage 4: Deployment

### Objective
Deploy the Agent to a production-ready environment.

### Tasks
- **Infrastructure Setup:**
  - Deploy IPFS node (e.g., via Infura or Pinata for pinning).
  - Configure AgentKit with production wallet and API key.
- **Build and Package:**
  - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript.
  - Bundle with dependencies (e.g., using Webpack or esbuild).
- **Deploy Application:**
  - Host on a server (e.g., AWS EC2, Vercel) or as a Docker container.
  - Expose API endpoints or CLI access.
- **Blockchain Deployment:**
  - Switch to mainnet (e.g., Base or Ethereum) with real funds.
- **CI/CD Integration:**
  - Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments.

### Tools
- Docker
- AWS, Vercel, or similar hosting
- GitHub Actions
- Infura/Pinata (IPFS hosting)
- Coinbase Developer Platform (mainnet)

### Deliverables
- Deployed Agent instance.
- Public API documentation (if applicable).
- CI/CD pipeline configuration.

---

## Stage 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

### Objective
Ensure long-term reliability and adaptability.

### Tasks
- **Monitoring:**
  - Track IPFS upload success rates and latency.
  - Monitor blockchain transaction statuses (e.g., via Etherscan API).
  - Log errors and performance metrics (e.g., using Sentry).
- **Maintenance:**
  - Update dependencies (e.g., AgentKit, IPFS client).
  - Patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Feature Expansion:**
  - Add multi-chain support (e.g., Solana, Polygon).
  - Implement AI enhancements (e.g., predictive billing).
- **User Support:**
  - Provide documentation and troubleshooting guides.

### Tools
- Sentry (error tracking)
- Prometheus/Grafana (metrics)
- Etherscan API (transaction monitoring)
- GitHub Issues (user feedback)

### Deliverables
- Monitoring dashboard.
- Regular update releases.
- User support resources.
