# Nebula Block Storage Example for Mac Silicon

This example demonstrates how to use Nebula Block object storage on Mac Silicon (Apple Silicon) machines using Python.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your Mac Silicon machine.

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual Nebula Block credentials:
   ```
   NEBULA_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_access_key
   NEBULA_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_secret_key
   NEBULA_ENDPOINT=your_actual_endpoint
   NEBULA_REGION=your_actual_region
   NEBULA_BUCKET=your_actual_bucket_name
   ```

   You can find these credentials in your Nebula Block account dashboard.

## Running the Example

Run the example script:
```bash
python nebula_block_example.py
```

The script will:
1. Connect to your Nebula Block storage
2. Create a test file
3. Upload the file to your bucket
4. List objects in the bucket
5. Generate a presigned URL for the file
6. Download the file
7. Delete the file from the bucket
8. Clean up local files

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure your Nebula Block credentials are correct
2. Check that your bucket exists and is accessible
3. Verify your internet connection
4. Enable debug logging by changing the logging level in the script:
   ```python
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```
