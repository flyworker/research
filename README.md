## Research Samples

This repository contains various research samples and implementations, including:

1. **AI Billing Agent Pipeline**
   - Implementation of decentralized billing systems
   - Integration of AI agents with blockchain technology
   - Secure payment processing using cryptographic verification

2. **Webhook Integration**
   - Sample implementations for agent communication
   - Event-driven architecture examples
   - API integration patterns

3. **Nebula Block Storage**
   - Example implementation for Nebula Block object storage
   - S3-compatible API usage
   - File upload, download, and management operations
   - Based on [Nebula Block Object Storage Documentation](https://docs.nebulablock.com/object-storage/tutorials/linuxmac)

4. **Team Billing API**
   - FastAPI application for managing teams, tracking usage, and generating invoices.
   - Uses SQLModel for database interactions (SQLite default).
   - Includes team creation, member invites, usage logging, and invoice generation/payment endpoints.
   - See `sample_code/team_billing/` for details.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
